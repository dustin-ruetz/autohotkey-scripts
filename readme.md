# autohotkey-scripts

[AutoHotkey][ahk] scripts to map keyboard shortcuts for opening Windows applications and files, copy and pasting file contents, running commands and passing command line arguments, starting workflows, etc. The scripts purposefully fill in gaps with keyboard shortcuts and are intended to increase the speed of OS power users.

Many of the items in [shortcuts.ahk][shortcuts] are written to launch applications that have been installed via [Scoop][scoop], a command-line installer for Windows.

Key legend:

* ^ = Ctrl
* \# = Windows key
* ! = Alt
* \+ = Shift
